# Hello, I'm Parnika Mathur! üëã

I am a rising Junior majoring in Computer Science with a keen interest in Machine Learning and AI. Currently, I am interning as a Research Assistant at Central Michigan University. Our research focuses on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Physics-Informed DeepONets (PI-DeepONets). We are developing programs to simulate these networks for various partial differential equations, including Burger‚Äôs 2D Equation and Navier-Stokes Equations. I will share more details once our research is published!

My journey in computer science has fueled my passion for Software Engineering, along with a strong interest in AI and Full Stack Web Developmente. To further explore these areas, I am currently a Software Engineering Fellow at Headstarter AI. Over the course of 7 weeks, I will be building 5+ AI projects that will significantly enhance my skills and knowledge in the field.
